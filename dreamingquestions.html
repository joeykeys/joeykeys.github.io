<a href="index.html">Top Page</a>

<h4>Chapter 0</h4>
</p> Who wrote software is hard? Who is that guy?: Donald Knuth</p>
</p> Programmers start counting at what number?: Zero</p> 
</p> What was the original sense of a hacker?: It was an obsessive program tinkerer</p>
</p>  According to a 2002 NIST study what % of software came in significantly late, over budget, or was canceled? About 66% of projects</p>
</p> Who wrote the 1987 essay entitled No Silver Bullet?: Frederick P. Brooks</p>

<h4>  Chapter 1 </h4>
</p>  What roles in the Chandler project did Michael Toy, John Anderson, Ted Burgess, Mitchell Kapor, and Lou Montulli hold.: They were to find the bugs (open problems / bugs)</p>
</p>What is Bugzilla?: A program that tracked all the tasks that needed to be finished</p>
</p> What is OSAF?: Open Source Applications Foundation</p>
</p>What is the projects name?: Chandler</p>
</p>What will the software do?: It's a Personal Information Manager</p>
</p> What is Toy’s keyword for black hole bugs?: Scary</p>
</p>What scared Toy so much about Bug 44?: Not knowing how long it would take to fix.</p>
</p> What did Toy refer to as a snake?: An important problem that they didn't know how to attack.</p>
</p>  In the software world, what does slippage mean?: Being late.</p>
</p>Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software project?: IBM's operating system, System/360. </p>
</p> What is Brooks's Law?: Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</p>
</p> Brooks found what % of project time was spent writing code?: About 16%.</p>
</p>  Brooks found what % of project time was for testing and fixing bugs?: About 50%.</p>
</p>Brooks observed that the unit of effort named man-month only applied under what conditions?: When a task can be partitioned among many workers with no communication among them.</p>
</p> What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer?: Source Code is written and coded into binary files that are used by the computer to display programs.</p>
</p>What is the one article of faith that all open source or free software advocates share?: Software that anyone can tinker with is bound to improve over time in ways that closed software cannot.</p>
</p> What is the difference between a good programmer and a great programmer?: Good programmers know what to write, and Great programmers know what to rewrite. </p>
</p> Eric Raymonds book The Cathedral and the Bazaar made a distinction between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast them.: The Cathedral approach was carefully crafted by a small amount of highly
skilled indivuals with no beta to be released, and the Bazaar approach was an open source code that was available to many programmers that allowed lots of different ideas and approaches to problems.</p>
</p> Has open source software project development refuted Brooks mythical man-month concerns?: No.</p>
</p> What was Andy Hertzfelds input when the Chandler project appeared to have stalled?: They lacked hustle.</p>

<h4>Chapter 2</h4>
</p>Linus Torvalds used a science and witchcraft analogy referring to software, explain.: He claimed that Science allowed for people to build on other people's work. But in witchcraft, their work was kept secret and private, therefore no one else could work to improve it. Torvald said this would lead to a software dying out.</p>
</p>People often refer to starting their computer as booting their computer. What was the origin of this term?: The builders of early computers had thought of it like pulling oneself up by the bootstraps, to describe the paradox of getting a computer up and running.</p>
</p>Where was the graphical user interface (GUI) developed?: At Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.</p>
</p>List three software project train wrecks: 1. Virtual Case File. 2. McDonalds Innovate 3. Fords Everest Procurement System</p>

<h4>Chapter 3</h4>
</p>When introducing a new technology or design, why did Frederick Brooks advise plan to throw one away?: Because you most likely will not get it right the first time.</p>
</p>What is a core dump? Why the use of the word core?: The computer drops everything, completely stops, and then spits out a file reporting the exact contents of its memory at the moment of failure. The word core refers to the computers active memory. </p>
</p>Rather than writing program statements in binary code, 110101110  1001101111, programmers developed a shorthand language called what?: Assembly Language </p>
</p>Adding layers of abstraction, new programming languages were created: Lisp, Cobol, Algol, Basic. Fortran was the first widely used. What kind of program converted Fortran to binary?: It was called a Complier.</p>

<h4>Chapter 4</h4>
</p>What do front ends and back ends mean to software developers?: The front end is what the user is seeing. The back end is where the result of front end events and inputs go so the computer can make sense of them, save them, and retrieve them.</p>
</p>What did the Lego Hypothesis refer to?: Programs being built of reusable software parts. These software parts would be available everywhere, so that you could take some pre-made pieces of code and plug them in to make some software without doing any coding. </p>
</p>Give one reason why the Lego Hypothesis seems to not work so well.: Unlike Legos, the software objects were not alike enough to be put together willy nilly. They varied enormously in size, function, and in their number of connections to other components. In actual programs, no components are constant.</p>

<h4>Chapter 5</h4>
</p>What is the three-way trade-off that many software projects struggle to overcome.: There are three major focuses of a project, but you can only fully do two of the three. If you try to do all three, you will either fail or they will all lack.</p>
</p>What is the more recent definition of geek?: A person who has chosen concentration rather than conformity, one who pursues skill and imagination, not mainstream social acceptance. </p>
</p>What does refactoring mean to programmers?: Rewriting a chunk of code to make it briefer, clearer, and easier to read without changing the function.</p>
</p>What is yak-shaving?: A seemingly pointless activity which is actually necessary to solve a problem which solves a problem which, several levels of recursion later, solves the actual problem you were originally working on.</p>

<h4>Chapter 6</h4>
</p>What is term edge cases referring to in software development?: Extreme possibilities and unlikely scenarios. Often where bugs hide.</p>
</p>Summarize briefly Linus Torvalds advice about large projects given in 2004: You should always start small and think about the details. Never expect to undertake a large project. If you do, you will overdesign and think it is more important than it is. Also, the project should solve a fairly immediate need, and if it doesn't then it is overdesigned.</p>

<h4>Chapter 7</h4>
</p>Briefly describe Hungarian notation: The Programmer appends a prefix to every variable name, that gives anyone reading the code important clues about what sort of variable it is.</p>
</p>What does the author state is the ...single most challenging demand of software development?: Communicating abstractions unambiguously; from programmer to machine, from programmer to programmer, and from program to user.</p>

<h4>Chapter 8</h4>
</p>What does eat your own dogfood mean?: Software Developers must use the products they are in the process of building.</p>
</p>Quote: When people ask for numbers that far out, the traditional thing that engineers do .... When discussing the timeline for Chandler, how was the quote above completed?: They just made up a timeline for when it would be Dogfoodable.</p>

<h4>Chapter 9</h4>
</p>Structured programming evolved to address what programming practice?: The Go-To Statement. The central idea was to compose a program as a collection of subunits, each of which having only one point of entry and one point of exit.</p>
</p>Was structured programming a solution to the problem of software development?: It was in a way. But it was not the final solution, rather, it laid a solid foundation for more ambitious software to come. </p>
</p>Have any techniques shown to improve the software development process?: Some worked for some projects, but there weren't any that were surefire methods / techniques to improve every software development process. </p>
</p>The waterfall model of programming was/is popular. What were some problems with this model?: It led to delay, confusion and disaster. Everything took forever and nothing worked correctly. Putting large chunks of code together all at the end caused the system to collapse as well. </p>
</p>What are the four tenets of Agile Software Development?: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Working software over comprehensive documentation. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Responding to change over following a plan.</p>
</p>What did a 2004 study find about the development practices of some two hundred software team leaders?: The most dominant development practice was no practice at all.</p>
</p>What is the Joel Test and what did he say about Microsoft and the Joel Test?: It is a short set of questions that are designed to judge whether a development organization has its act together. Microsoft scores perfectly on the test.</p>
</p>What is Rosenberg’s Law?: Software is easy to make except when you want it to do something new. And the only software that is worth making is software that does something new. Therefore, software is never easy to make.</p>

<h4>Chapter 10</h4>
</p>Chapter 10 is about the notion of “Software Engineering” and the difficulty of applying this label to the development of software. 
The author suggests that Yertle the Turtle provides an important lesson for programmers. Describe it.: </p>
