<a href="index.html">Top Page</a>

<h4>Chapter 0</h4>
</p> Who wrote “software is hard?” Who is that guy? Donald Knuth</p>
</p> Programmers start counting at what number? Zero</p> 
</p> What was the original sense of a “hacker?" : It was an obsessive program tinkerer</p>
</p>  According to a 2002 NIST study what % of software came in significantly late, over budget, or was canceled? About 66% of projects</p>
</p> Who wrote the 1987 essay entitled “No Silver Bullet?” Frederick P. Brooks</p>
<h4>  Chapter 1 </h4>
</p>  What roles in the Chandler project did Michael Toy, John Anderson, Ted Burgess, Mitchell Kapor, and Lou Montulli hold.: They were to find the bugs (open problems / bugs)</p>
</p>What is “Bugzilla?”: A program that tracked all the tasks that needed to be finished</p>
</p> What is OSAF?: Open Source Applications Foundation</p>
</p>What is the projects name?: Chandler</p>
</p>What will the software do?: It's a Personal Information Manager</p>
</p> What is Toy’s keyword for “black hole” bugs?: Scary</p>
</p>What scared Toy so much about Bug 44?: Not knowing how long it would take to fix.</p>
</p> What did Toy refer to as a “snake?”: An important problem that they didn't know how to attack.</p>
</p>  In the software world, what does “slippage” mean?: Being late.</p>
</p>Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software project?: IBM's operating system, System/360. </p>
</p> What is Brooks's Law?: Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</p>
</p> Brooks found what % of project time was spent writing code?: About 16%.</p>
</p>  Brooks found what % of project time was for testing and fixing bugs?: About 50%.</p>
</p>Brooks observed that the unit of effort named “man-month” only applied under what conditions?: When a task can be partitioned among many workers with no communication among them.</p>
</p> What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer?: Source Code is written and coded into binary files that are used by the computer to display programs.</p>
</p>What is the one “article of faith” that all “open source” or “free” software advocates share?: Software that anyone can tinker with is bound to improve over time in ways that closed software cannot.</p>
</p> What is the difference between a “good” programmer and a “great” programmer?: Good programmers know what to write, and Great programmers know what to rewrite. </p>
</p> Eric Raymond’s book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” made a distinction between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast them.: The Cathedral approach was carefully crafted by a small amount of highly
skilled indivuals with no beta to be released, and the Bazaar approach was an open source code that was available to many programmers that allowed lots of different ideas and approaches to problems.</p>
</p> Has “open source” software project development refuted Brooks’s “mythical man-month” concerns?: No.</p>
</p> What was Andy Hertzfeld’s input when the Chandler project appeared to have stalled?: They lacked "hustle".</p>
<h4>Chapter 2</h4>
</p>Linus Torvalds used a “science” and “witchcraft” analogy referring to software, explain.: He claimed that Science allowed for people to build on other people's work. But in witchcraft, their work was kept secret and private, therefore no one else could work to improve it. Torvald said this would lead to a software dying out.</p>
</p>People often refer to starting their computer as “booting” their computer. What was the origin of this term?</p>
</p>Where was the graphical user interface (GUI) developed?</p>
</p>List three software project “train wrecks.”</p>
<h4>Chapter 3</h4>
</p>When introducing a new technology or design, why did Frederick Brooks advise “plan to throw one away?”</p>
</p>What is a “core” dump? Why the use of the word core?</p>
</p>Rather than writing program statements in binary code, 110101110  1001101111, programmers developed a shorthand language called what?</p>
</p>Adding layers of abstraction, new programming languages were created: Lisp, Cobol, Algol, Basic. Fortran was the first widely used. What kind of program converted Fortran to binary?</p>
