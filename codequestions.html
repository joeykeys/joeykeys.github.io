<h4>Chapter 11</h4>
</p>Briefly describe the four gates explained in Chapter 11. Describe the behavior of each gate based on the input values to the gate.: AND Gates are made up of Two Inputs. Both Inputs need to be On (closed) in order for the Single Output to receive power. The OR Gate has Two Inputs, and One Output. 
But only One Input needs to be On (closed) in order for the Output to receive power. The Output also receives power if both Inputs are On (closed). 
NOR Gates are the exact opposite of OR Gates. NAND Gates are the exact opposite of AND Gates. </p>

<h4>Chapter 12</h4>
</p>A half adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many inputs and outputs?: </p>
</p>A full adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many inputs and outputs?: </p>
</p>How many total inputs and outputs are there for an 8-bit adding circuit?: </p>
</p>How many total transistors are needed for the ripple version of the 8-bit adder?: </p>
